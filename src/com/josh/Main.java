//DO this to get the deck of cards setup and then deal out the cards and set them up with arrays for the player hand
//and the computer hand and then remove them from the 'deck' as I do this?

//As we just learned classes would I setup a 'hand' class and then setup a player.hand as well as a computer.hand and
//from there?   Adding to these and removing from the deck, etc.

//Thanks!//
